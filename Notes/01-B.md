# Hello headers

``` cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

project(hello_headers)

set(SOURCES
    src/Hello.cpp
    src/main.cpp
)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES})

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}
    PRIVATE
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
```
obtain multiple sources into one variate by using `set(SOURCES source_list)`, then we can use this single variate as a list of dirs.

By using `target_include_directories()`, it works by adding `-I/directory/path` to the complier.
