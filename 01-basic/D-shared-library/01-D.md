# Shared library
[reference](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/)
> A dynamic library (also called a shared library) consists of routines that are loaded into your application at run time. When you compile a program that uses a dynamic library, the library does not become part of your executable -- it remains as a separate unit. On Windows, dynamic libraries typically have a .dll (dynamic link library) extension, whereas on Linux, dynamic libraries typically have a .so (shared object) extension. One advantage of dynamic libraries is that many programs can share one copy, which saves space. Perhaps a bigger advantage is that the dynamic library can be upgraded to a newer version without replacing all of the executables that use it.

## Create a shared library
In the code below, a shared library `hello_library` is created, and added the include directory. In the end, a alias was given.
``` cmake
add_library(hello_library SHARED
    src/Hello.cpp
)
target_include_directories(hello_library
    PUBLIC
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
add_library(hello::library ALIAS hello_library)
```

## Problems in Windows&MSVC

* MSVC cannot directly link to a dll -> we need a so-called “import library”.
* Symbol Visibility: GCC/MinGW exports all symbols by default, MSVC exports no symbol by default.
``` cmake
if(MSVC)
    set(CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS TRUE)
    set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS TRUE)
endif()
```
The size of the shared version is a little samller than the static version:

```
// shared version
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----          6/7/2021  11:29 AM          52736 hello_binary.exe

// static version
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----          6/7/2021  10:28 AM          58880 hello_binary.exe
```
