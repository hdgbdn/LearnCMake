# Static library
[reference](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/)
> A static library (also known as an archive) consists of routines that are compiled and linked directly into your program.
> When you compile a program that uses a static library, all the functionality of the static library that your program uses becomes part of your executable.
## Creat a static library
The code below define a static library named `hello_library`, and set it's source files.
``` cmake
add_library(hello_library STATIC
    src/Hello.cpp
)
```

## Populating Including Directories
Include directories in the library using the `target_include_directories()` function with the scope set to `PUBLIC`.
```cmake
target_include_directories(hello_library
    PUBLIC
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
```

The meaning of scopes are:

* `PRIVATE` - the directory is added to this targetâ€™s include directories

* `INTERFACE` - the directory is added to the include directories for any targets that link this library.

* `PUBLIC` - As above, it is included in this library and also any targets that link this library.

## Linking a Library
```cmake 
add_executable(hello_binary
    src/main.cpp
)

target_link_libraries(hello_binary
    PRIVATE
        hello_library
)
```
This tells CMake to link the `hello_library` against the `hello_binary` executable during link time. It will also propagate any include directories with `PUBLIC` or `INTERFACE` scope from the linked library target. In this case, the directory `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include` which is marked as `PUBLIC` will be included in `hello_binary`.
